Description
================
This bundle generates admin pages automatically with no need for configuration.
You can manage your Doctrine entities (list, create, edit, delete and associations, when included in entities) 
The interface is simple and without clutter nor noise and makes use of `__toString()` methods to display meaningful information.
It only works with Single Column Identifiers for now but support for composite keys may be added in the future.

Installation
================
1. Run `composer require lalamefine/autoadmin`
2. If not done automatically, add the bundle in `config/bundles.php`:
    ```php
    return [
        // ...
        Lalamefine\Autoadmin\LalamefineAutoadminBundle::class => ['all' => true], // add this line
    ];
    ```
3. Add the route in `config/routes/autoadmin.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    autoadmin:
        resource: '@LalamefineAutoadminBundle/config/routes.yaml'
        prefix: autoadmin
    ```
    You can change the prefix if you want (e.g. `admin`).
4. __âš  WARNING__ Configure security to restrict access :

    You need to configure security at routing level <br>
    I do recommand restricting `/autoadmin` (or your custom prefix) to a specific user role in `config/packages/security.yaml`.

    ```yaml
    security: 
        # ...
        access_control:
            - { path: ^/autoadmin, roles: ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN } # Add & customize this line
            # ...
    ```
